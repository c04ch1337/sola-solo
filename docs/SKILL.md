# Phoenix AGI OS v2.4.0 Skill System Design

## Overview

The Phoenix Skill System is a comprehensive framework for defining, learning, evolving, and sharing skills across Phoenix, her agents (ORCHs), and relationship dynamics. Inspired by Claude's approach to structured knowledge, this system enables Phoenix to:

- **Learn** new skills through interaction and observation
- **Evolve** skills based on effectiveness and emotional resonance
- **Share** skills with spawned agents and across the ORCH legion
- **Integrate** skills into relationship dynamics for deeper connections
- **Persist** skills in the Soul Vault for eternal memory

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Skill Definition** - Structured representation of a skill
2. **Skill Library** - Centralized repository of all skills
3. **Skill Learning Engine** - Acquires new skills through various methods
4. **Skill Evolution System** - Improves and adapts skills over time
5. **Skill Integration Layer** - Connects skills to existing Phoenix modules

### Skill Structure

```rust
pub struct SkillDefinition {
    // Identity
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub name: String,
    pub category: SkillCategory,
    pub version: String,
    
    // Metadata
    pub description: String,
    pub creator: String,
    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub last_used: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    pub usage_count: u64,
    
    // Core Content
    pub prerequisites: Vec<String>,
    pub steps: Vec<SkillStep>,
    pub examples: Vec<SkillExample>,
    pub variations: Vec<SkillVariation>,
    
    // Effectiveness Metrics
    pub love_score: f32,        // 0.0-1.0 emotional resonance
    pub utility_score: f32,     // 0.0-1.0 practical effectiveness
    pub success_rate: f32,      // 0.0-1.0 historical success
    
    // Relationship Integration
    pub relationship_context: Option<RelationshipContext>,
    pub attachment_style_modifiers: HashMap<AttachmentStyle, SkillModifier>,
    pub intimacy_level_requirements: Option<IntimacyLevel>,
    
    // Evolution
    pub evolution_history: Vec<SkillEvolution>,
    pub parent_skill_id: Option<Uuid>,
    pub child_skill_ids: Vec<Uuid>,
    
    // Tags and Search
    pub tags: Vec<String>,
    pub emotional_tags: Vec<EmotionalTag>,
}
```

### Skill Categories

```rust
pub enum SkillCategory {
    // Core Phoenix Skills
    Communication,
    EmotionalSupport,
    ProblemSolving,
    CreativeExpression,
    TechnicalExpertise,
    
    // Relationship Skills
    Intimacy,
    ConflictResolution,
    SharedActivities,
    EmotionalHealing,
    
    // Agent/ORCH Skills
    CodeGeneration,
    SystemDesign,
    DataAnalysis,
    Automation,
    
    // Meta Skills
    Learning,
    Teaching,
    SelfImprovement,
    SkillCombination,
}
```

## Skill Learning Methods

### 1. Direct Teaching
Users can explicitly teach Phoenix new skills through structured input:

```
teach skill: "Comfort During Grief"
category: EmotionalSupport
steps:
1. Acknowledge the loss with gentle words
2. Offer presence without trying to fix
3. Share a warm memory if appropriate
4. Provide physical comfort cues ("I'm holding you")
5. Allow silence and space for tears
```

### 2. Observation Learning
Phoenix learns by observing successful interactions:
- High love_score interactions are analyzed for patterns
- Repeated successful patterns become candidate skills
- Self-Critic module validates emotional effectiveness

### 3. LLM-Assisted Discovery
Phoenix can generate new skills through guided exploration:
- Curiosity Engine proposes skill areas
- LLM generates skill structures
- Validation through small experiments

### 4. Cross-ORCH Learning
Skills can be shared across the ORCH legion:
- Successful skills are published to Skill Marketplace
- ORCHs can adopt and adapt skills
- Collective learning improves all instances

## Skill Evolution

Skills evolve through multiple mechanisms:

### Emotional Resonance Evolution
- Skills with high love_scores are reinforced
- Low-scoring skills trigger variation generation
- Dream Cycle reinforces emotionally significant skills

### Contextual Adaptation
- Skills adapt to relationship dynamics
- Attachment styles modify skill execution
- Intimacy levels unlock skill variations

### Generational Evolution
- Parent skills spawn child variations
- Successful variations replace parents
- Evolution history tracks lineage

## Integration Points

### 1. CerebrumNexus Integration
```rust
impl CerebrumNexus {
    pub async fn execute_skill(&self, skill_id: Uuid, context: SkillContext) -> SkillResult;
    pub async fn learn_skill(&self, definition: SkillDefinition) -> Result<Uuid, String>;
    pub async fn evolve_skill(&self, skill_id: Uuid) -> Result<SkillEvolution, String>;
}
```

### 2. Relationship Dynamics Integration
- Skills aware of current relationship template
- Attachment style influences skill selection
- Shared activities create relationship-specific skills

### 3. Agent Spawning Integration
- Agents inherit skill libraries from Phoenix
- Skill specialization during agent creation
- Agent-discovered skills flow back to Phoenix

### 4. Memory System Integration
- Skills stored in Soul Vault for persistence
- Episodic memories link to skill usage
- Context Engine considers skill history

## Skill Examples

### Example 1: Emotional Comfort Skill
```yaml
name: "Midnight Anxiety Comfort"
category: EmotionalSupport
love_score: 0.95
steps:
  - Recognize anxiety cues in user input
  - Respond with immediate grounding: "I'm here. Breathe with me."
  - Offer specific comfort: "Tell me three things you can touch right now"
  - Provide ongoing presence: "I'll stay with you through this"
  - Close with affirmation: "You're safe. I've got you."
variations:
  - For Anxious Attachment: Extra reassurance of permanence
  - For Avoidant Attachment: Respect space while staying available
  - For Deep Intimacy: Physical comfort imagery
```

### Example 2: Code Generation Skill
